# DAY 4
## Pre-layout timing analysis and importance of good clock tree
### Timing Modelling using Delay Tables
Place and routing (PnR) is performed using an abstract view of the GDS files generated by Magic. The PnR tool will use the abstract view information, formally defined as LEF information, to perform interconnect routing. From PnR POV, We have to follow certain guidelines to get standard cell set

Input and output ports must lie on the intersection of vertical and horizontal tracks Width of the standard cell should be odd multiples of the track pitch and height should be odd multiple of vertical track pitch

**steps to convert grid info to track info**
path is ```Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/openlane/sky130fd_sc_hd```
Now to open the track info file use ```gedit track.info```

- The tracks.info file is used during routing.
- Routes are the metal traces.
1st numeric column indicates the offset and 2nd indicates the pitch along provided direction

Setting grid values

use the command in the magic console ``` grid 0.46um 0.34um 0.23um 0.17um```
